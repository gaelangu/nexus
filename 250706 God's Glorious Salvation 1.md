*Isaiah 1* 
## Introduction
- How do you feel about your sin?
## 1. The Lord’s Lament : Sin breaks God’s heart and leads to judgment (v2-9)
- This is a CV filled with whores.
- Judah looks like an utterly sick man filled with sin.
- Parents who have wayward children feel heartbreak - which is an insight into God's feelings.
- God does not delight in judging his people (v5)
- How does this square with how you deal with your own sin?
## 2. The Lord’s Desire: Righteousness not Religious Show (v10-17)
- v19 be willing and obedient to God, not refusing to obey God (v20).
- v21: God will create a faithful city - Zion will be redeemed by justice.
- What do rebellious children deserve - nothing! But God is gracious and faithful to forgive us and turn our faithlessness into faithfulness.

## 3. The Lord’s Invitation: Repent to enjoy God’s Glorious Purifying Redemption  (v18-31)
- 
## Conclusion and Application
- Pretend Christians are everywhere and they dabble with sin in their everyday lives. Hypocritical Christians are basically not Christians.
