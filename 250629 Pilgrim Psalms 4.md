*Pilgrim Psalms: Help on Our Journey to Heaven #4* 
*Psalm 123*

## Introduction


## 1. Scorn and Contempt (V3-4)
- Those who scoff at giving up themselves to follow the cross - these people are at peace with themselves.
- These scorns don't just come from outside but also within the church.
## 2. Look hopefully to our enthroned merciful God (v1-2)
- The psalm is calling us to look to our God in heaven - like the eyes of a servant to their master.
- Look to the one seated and enthroned in the heavens. 
- Jesus, who was scorned by the world with contempt, did not turn on the world. He entrusted himself to a Lord who is merciful.
## Conclusion
- All scorn will be defeated in the end.
- What do we do in the face of scornful contempt?

## Thinking it through…
1. Think of a time you have faced derision for being a Christian. How has Psalm 123 helped you in thinking and dealing with contempt?
2. Who or what do you look to for help when you face scorn and contempt? How does Jesus’ example motivate you to look for God to help instead?

Pray: Meditate on who God is, thank him for who he is and ask for His help to look to his merciful character in times of contempt. Cry to him for mercy!
