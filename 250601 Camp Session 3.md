# Questions for reflection
- Consider what most struck you from Romans 3:21–26
- Think how you could explain how it is possible for a righteous God to declare unrighteous people “righteous” and still remain righteous himself?
- Reflect on "Paul’s day trip" and spend time rejoicing in justification, redemption and propitiation through substitution.
- Thank God for his amazing grace.
- Pray about people you know who are not following Jesus. Pray they will come to realise that neither their ethnicity, nor their moral or religious performance will make them right with God.
- Ask the LORD to give you such a love for unbelievers around you, and an awareness of their plight in facing God’s wrath that you would both be urgent in telling them the good news and delight to do so.
