*Romans 3:21–31*

# Introduction — facing the unstoppable storm of God’s wrath
- We cannot plead ignorance because God's work is plain to see.
- There are 2 problems:
    - Our unrighteousness has caused the wrath of God.
    - 
# 1. Declared righteous—come on a day trip v21–26

- Justification—the law court ⚖️
	- We are justified by grace.
- Redemption—the slave market ☹️
	- We discover we are one of the slaves - in chains. 
	- When we ran away from our Master, we became enslaved to other masters.
	- Our old Master paid with his son to set us free.
- Propitiation—the temple ⛪
	- Even if he declares us worthy, he does not become unrighteous but shows his righteousness.
	- The cross is the only way to be rescued from God's wrath.

- In declaring wicked people righteous, God himself is righteous.
- The law only tells me I have sinned but it does not cleanse me of my sin.
# 2. Humbled—go on a lifetime mission v27–31
- We cannot be saved from keeping the law.
# Conclusion
- 1:14 I am under obligation to proclaim the gospel to everyone
- 1:15 I am eager to proclaim the gospel to Christians
- 1:16 I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for salvation

# Questions for reflection
- Consider what most struck you from Romans 3:21–26
- Think how you could explain how it is possible for a righteous God to declare unrighteous people “righteous” and still remain righteous himself?
- Reflect on "Paul’s day trip" and spend time rejoicing in justification, redemption and propitiation through substitution.
- Thank God for his amazing grace.
- Pray about people you know who are not following Jesus. Pray they will come to realise that neither their ethnicity, nor their moral or religious performance will make them right with God.
- Ask the LORD to give you such a love for unbelievers around you, and an awareness of their plight in facing God’s wrath that you would both be urgent in telling them the good news and delight to do so.
