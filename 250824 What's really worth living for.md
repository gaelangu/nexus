## Introduction

*John 10:10-11*
> “I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”

## 1. Jesus is really worth living for – He’s the creator of everything we love
*Colossians 1:15-17*
> He (Jesus) is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 16 For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. 17 And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

- Jesus made everything we love.
- By Jesus, all things were created.
## 2. Jesus is really worth living for – His invitation is to a feast beyond our wildest dreams (John 2:1-11)
- Jesus made a lot of wine - that is about 500 to 600 litres of wine, of exceptional quality. 
- Jesus died to pay for all our sins.
