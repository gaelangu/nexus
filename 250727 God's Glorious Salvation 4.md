*Isaiah 6*
## Why doesn’t everyone believe?
- Good news needs to be contrasted against the backdrop of difficult dark news.
- It's difficult to deal with sin and judgment.
## Why is this chapter here? (v1)
- God's rule is permanent and there is never a transfer of power.
- It can make some feel threatened under a dictator but it can make some like Isaiah feel secure.
## Encountering our Holy God (v1-5)

## Understanding Isaiah’s Terrible Mission (v8-13)
*John 12:37-41, Acts 28:25-27 (Also, Matthew 13:13-15 , Mark 4:11-12)*
- v10, people stop caring about what He says.
- God wants to wipe the slate clean.
## Finding Hope in Atonement (v6-7)
- It must involve sacrifice and atonement.
- The death of our saviour is the perfect atonement for our sins.
- Our sin makes us fall asleep spiritually.
## Thinking it through…
