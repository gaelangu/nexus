*Matthew 25:1-13*


# 1. Introduction – Being prepared
- We will not know when Jesus will return.
- There will only be 2 groups of people - the wise and foolish.

# 2. Context


# 3. V1-5 The bridegroom is delayed for the wedding feast; the foolish are unprepared, the wise are.
- The foolish virgins don't take oil with them, but the wise do, as they are expecting a long night.
- Which items during your week are not preparing for Jesus' return? What are non-negotiables?

(For bridegroom reference, see Matthew 9:14-17)


# 4. V6-13 The bridegroom arrives for the wedding feast: the wise join Him, the foolish are shut out.

- Surrounding yourself with Kingdom people does not guarantee Kingdom access. 
- Those who were unprepared are not known to God.
- Following Jesus is not a one-off action but a life of follow-up action.

(For marriage feast reference, see Matthew 22:1-14)
(For Sermon on the Mount reference, see Matthew 7:21-27)


# 5. Conclusion


----
# *Thinking it through...*
1. *What steps can you take to be personally ready for Jesus’ return?*
