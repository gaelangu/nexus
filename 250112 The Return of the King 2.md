# *Thinking it through...*
1. *How does it help you to know that God is in control of all things, between Jesus’ first and second coming? What makes you struggle to believe it?*
2. *How have Jesus’ words shaped how you will wait for him?*

*Pray: we would wait for Jesus with quiet confidence knowing that our Father controls all things. Pray we would wait with eager expectation, knowing Jesus’ return will be glorious.*
