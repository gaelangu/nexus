*Titus 1:1-4*

# Introduction
- At the heart of Christianity is for the people to display the heart of Jesus. 
- Godliness is critically important in a Christian's life. 
- The Cretan church was rife with sin (v12).

## Context
- 1:5
- 1:10
- 1:12
- 3:15

# 1. Healthy Churches focus on one thing: Truth (v1)
- “the knowledge of the truth” = gospel (3x in Pastoral Epistles - 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Tim 2:25; 3:7)
- “the truth” = gospel (7x in Pastoral Epistles - 1 Tim 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Tim 2:18; 3:8; 4:4; Tit 1:14).
- If we want godliness to be the end goal, we need to know ==the truth of the gospel.==
- Love without truth is not very Christian because it means abandoning the bible.
# 2. Healthy Churches have one goal: Salvation (v1b-4)
- The hope of salvation that God promised is true, because He never lies.
- Paul wants us to know that God is a saving god - Jesus our Savior is mentioned 6x in the first 3 chapters.
    - Title for God/Jesus (1:3, 4; 2:10, 13; 3:4, 6)

# *Thinking it through…*
1. *How have you been helped to think about how you can grow in godliness?*
2. *What could you do to be on the receiving end of the Bible more?*
*Pray: For desire, focus and discipline to be on the receiving end of the Bible at church, CG/WoW, family, personal time.*
