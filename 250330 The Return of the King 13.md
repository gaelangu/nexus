*Matthew 27:55-28:15*

# If it sounds too good to be true…

# Jesus has risen from the dead! (28:1-10)
- Angel said He has risen as He said (28:6).
- The truthfulness of His words was confirmed by eyewitnesses.

*(Matthew 16:21, 17:22-23, 20:18-19 & 26;31-32)*

# But some people will tell you a different story (27:62-66 & 28:11-15)

# Understanding unbelief
- There was so much evidence but yet many did not believe; continued to believe in lies told by their own leaders. 
- It is not a matter of the mind but of the heart.

# Rejoicing in the resurrection


----
# *Thinking it through…*
1. *How has Matthew helped you better understand unbelief? How does that help you?*
2. *Are you rejoicing in the resurrection? How could God’s word today help you do so more?*
*Pray: give thanks that Jesus is alive, that we can believe he truly is our king and saviour, and that we wouldn’t be discouraged by those who don’t believe it.*
