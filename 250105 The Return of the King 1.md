*Matthew 24:1-14* 

# The End
There is only one end that all Christians look forward to.

How can I be a faithful disciple while I wait - that is more important than predicting when Jesus would return. Many false prophets will arise and lead disciples away - and this is in great multitude. Jesus warns about enduring to the end, as the consequences of being led astray lasts for all eternity.
# Matthew’s Gospel Structure
## A. Introduction (1:1-4:25)
> “Immanuel...God with us” (1:23)

Jesus is the only one who knows the truth. We must not just avoid false teaching but claim the truth.
## B. Five “Sermons” (5:1-7:29 → 10:1-42 → 13:1-53 → 18:1-35 → 24:1-25:46)
All conclude, “When Jesus had finished teaching...”

## C. Conclusion (26:1-28:20)
> “I am with you always” (28:20)

# A chilling prediction (24:1-3)
*(Matthew 23:37-39)*

## 1. Don’t be led astray (v4-13)
### Alarmed by a troubling world (v4-8)
The one who endures to the end will be saved.
### Alarmed by a persecuted church (v9-13)

## 2. The Gospel Must Go to All Nations (v14)
### Endure!
#### ... by avoiding false teaching
#### ... by engaging in God’s mission
- Prayer is the best way for us to support mission partners.
- If praying alone is challenging, pray with CG.

# Thinking it through...
1. How have Jesus’ words made you more aware of the danger of false teaching? What will it look like for you to listen more closely to Jesus?
2. How could you be more engaged in God’s mission of bringing the gospel to all nations in the coming year?

*Pray: Pray that we would endure until the end by listening to Jesus, not false teaching, and by staying engaged in God’s mission to bring the gospel to all nations.*
