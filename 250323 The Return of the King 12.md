*Matthew 27:27-54*
# Jesus’ Death: Climactic or Hype?
This is regarded as the turning point in history. The cross is the climactic and pivotal moment in history.

# Climax 1: A Mocked King in Service (Mat.27:27-31)
- Jesus was mocked and shamed by humanity.
- This is a climactic moment that reveals the character of God's king.
- Ironically they have made this moment such a fitting moment for Jesus, in their mockery. God's kingdom is built on humility and self-sacrifice.
# Climax 2: A Crushed King in Power (Mat.27:32-50)
- God's power is revealed on the cross through the crushed king.
# Climax 3: A Dead King in Victory (Mat.27:51-54)
- The curtain was torn the moment Jesus died. 
- Only Jesus' death can bring us closer to God.
# Jesus’ Death: Climactic or Hype?
- Only God can make us see Jesus' death as a climactic point in history.

# *Thinking it through…*
1. *How Jesus’ Kingship (humility & self-sacrifice) is counter-cultural & counter-intuitive.*
*(a) Which aspects of Jesus’ Kingship cut against what our world values & aspires?*
*(b) Which aspects have turned your world right side up?*
2. *‘Calvary is the turning point of world history’ & ‘The cross is the most amazing and glorious event that ever happened in the universe’. Do you agree or disagree? How has or hasn’t the cross been a turning point for your life?*

*Pray: Thank God for Jesus our true King who humbly and sacrificially served us even unto death, so that we may live through him by faith. Pray that the eyes of our hearts are enlightened to comprehend the breadth, length, height and depth of Christ’s love for us.*
