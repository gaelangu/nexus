*Titus 2:11-15*
# Introduction
- God commands godly living.
# 1. The appearance of Grace trains (v11-12)
## Grace appeared
- Crete was a pagan city, with people doing whatever they want and not being loyal to king Jesus.
- There were false teachers running amok, and teaching do's and don'ts according to the Jewish laws.
- The Grace of God has appeared - what does this mean?
## … to bring salvation
- Jesus has given himself for our salvation.
- This salvation is enough for everyone, all sinners.
## … and trains our behaviour
- Renounce ungodliness and ungodly passions.
- It trains us to reject sin, not flirt with it.
- We must be killing sin, or sin will be killing us.
- It's not about what we turn *from*, but what we turn *to*.
# 2. The appearance of Glory motivates (v13-14)
- Glory of God will be fully unveiled.
- Jesus' coming will be so amazing that we will be fully transformed on that day.
