*Titus 1:5-16*
# Introduction
- We need continuous church planting to establish healthy churches to push out false preachers.

# 1) The Problem: An island overrun with false teachers (v10-16)
- Things were not in order in Crete, there were many false preachers.
- They were devoted to Jewish myths, and it was for shameful gain (popularity, money).
## a) Identity
- They are insubordinate, deceiving and unbelieving.
- They are disobedient and unfit for any good work.
- Paul disagrees with false teachings because they destroy the lives of Christians.
## b) Influence
- It upsets whole families and destroys people's confidence in the gospel.

# 2) The Solution: Saturate the island with true teachers (v5-6)
- Look for 3 qualities in true teachers.
## a) Above reproach in family life
- It does not mean you must be perfect in family life. 
- It means you are unaccusable and unimpeachable.
- Married pastors need to be faithful to their spouses.
- Children need to be brought up well in the Lord.
## b) Above reproach in personal life
- Must not be arrogant, quick tempered, drunk, greedy for gain.
- Must be hospitable, holy, disciplined, upright.
- Who I am in private is more important than what is projected in public.
## c) Faithful bold teacher of God’s word

### Hold firm

### Give instruction
- All gospel ministry is Word ministry.
### Rebuke
- Call it like it is.
- Silence and sharply rebuke false teachers.
- We need those with guts and spiritual steel.

## *Thinking it through…*
1) *How have you been sharpened in your thinking about what we need to pray and work towards at The Crossing?*
2) *If you are considering full-time ministry: How have you been challenged?*
