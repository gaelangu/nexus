*Matthew 28:16-20*

# Introduction
Our mission does not stop with sharing the gospel. 
# 1. The Basis of Mission: Jesus’ Universal Authority (v18)
- The church exists for nothing but to draw people in to make them little Christs.
# 2. The Command to Mission: Universal Disciple-Making (v19a-20a)
- The big call is to make disciples.
- Jesus works through us and we are never alone. He gives us the Holy Spirit.
- With Jesus, fulfilment has come.

> By Going… Baptising… Teaching…

# 3. The Assurance of Mission: Jesus’ Universal Presence (v20b)


# Summary and Application
- Matthew structured his gospel to mirror the OT.
- He wants to show that the promise has been completed in Jesus.
- Is your life aligned with Jesus' mission to make disciples, or are you somehow distracted?
## The structure of Matthew’s Gospel:
- Begins in Matt 1 like Genesis with genealogies (10x in Genesis)
- Five teaching blocks (Matt 5-7, 10, 13, 18, 24-25 – all about discipleship) // Five books of Moses
- Ends like the last book of the Hebrew Canon in 2 Chron 36:23

## Homework:
- What 3 similarities are there in Matt 28:19-20 & 2 Chron 36:23? 
- How does this add to the significance of what Jesus says about himself, and therefore what he commands us to do?

*Thinking it through…*
*“Make disciples”: How has your life’s mission been clarified today? How will that impact how you live from now on?*

*What holds you back from making disciples overseas? How has God’s word challenged you today?*

*Pray: Hearts to obey Jesus and rely on the Spirit to be bold disciple-makers. Pray for God’s leading about whether overseas mission could be for you.*
