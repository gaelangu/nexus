# Questions for personal reflection and prayer

Spend some time praying about the things that especially struck you from the first talk.

- What are the dominant emotions you feel when you think about evangelism?
- *“Paul proclaims the gospel, to those who know the gospel, because it is the gospel that motivates us to proclaim the gospel.”* How will Paul’s approach to motivate us in evangelism helps overcome any reluctance we have in evangelism?
- Generally, we have no problem talking about the things we’re excited about. Spend some time in prayer asking the LORD to so excite you with the gospel that your excitement will overcome any reluctance you feel to speak about Jesus.
- Read through chapter 1 verses 1-6 and remind yourself of the content of the gospel and then consider if these things are the things you seek to speak about in gospel conversations.
