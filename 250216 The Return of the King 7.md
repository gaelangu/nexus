*Matthew 26:1-16*

# Introduction

# Context
- Contrast between one who sees Jesus as priceless, and the other sees Him as worthless.

# 1. In God’s sovereignty, Jesus will be betrayed to death as the Passover sacrifice (26:1-5)
- Jesus was going to die as the Passover sacrifice.
- Mercy was shown to Israelites and righteous judgement upon Egypt.

# 2. Jesus and His coming death is priceless to the woman (26:6-13)


# 3. Jesus and His coming death is worthless to Judas Iscariot (26:14-16)
> *“And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them.”*
>
> *Zechariah 11:12-13*

- Judas did not see the value of Jesus' death and accepted only a mere 30 pieces of silver for it.
# Conclusion
- There is a stark contrast between the woman and Judas.
- Meditate on the significance of Jesus' death, as a Passover sacrifice for our sins.
- God's righteous judgement would pass over us as a result.
- Do our decisions in life show that we will quickly trade Jesus in a moment, and we don't put Him as the top priority in our lives?
- How are we any different from Judas if we look at Jesus as worthless and are willing to trade Him for the things of this world?
