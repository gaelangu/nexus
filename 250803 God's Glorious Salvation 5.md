*Isaiah 7:1-8:10*

## Introduction
7:9 is the key!

## 1. Ahaz’s Faith Tested (7:1-2)
King Ahaz of Judah
vs
King Rezin of Syria (Damascus) + King Pekah of Israel (Ephraim/ Samaria)

## 2. The LORD’s Assurance & Call for Faithfulness (7:3-9)
- Ahaz dumps his faith in God at the first hint of trouble.
- He is not that different from many of us.
- "If you are not firm in faith, you are not firm at all."
## 3. Ahaz’s Faithlessness (7:10-12; 2 Kings 16:5-8)
> 2 Kings 16:5-8: “Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him…7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.” 8 Ahaz also took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasures of the king's house and sent a present to the king of Assyria.”

## 4. The LORD’s Sign of Judgment & Salvation (7:13-8:10)
7:14-17
### (a) Judgment for the Faithless Rebels
7:15, 21-22
- Eating curds and honey is a sign of judgment.
- The Assyrian army is going to flood into the land of Judah and come into Jerusalem - this is God's warning to judge them for their faithlessness.
The four “In that day” phrases v18-25
8:5-8
### (b) Salvation for the Faithful Remnant
- First indication: Isaiah’s son, Shear-jashub, means “a remnant will return” (7:3)
	- Immanuel will return.
- Second positive indication - 7:16
- Third positive indication - 8:9-10

> Matt 1:21-24 – “She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 23 “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us).”

- Our response to God really matters.
- If we put our faith in the world, it will lead to God's judgment.

## Thinking it through…
- How has today’s passage exposed the folly of faithlessness?
- How has it helped you to be firm in your faith (7:9)?
*Pray: For God’s help to have an unwavering faith in Jesus, not in ourselves or the things of our world*
