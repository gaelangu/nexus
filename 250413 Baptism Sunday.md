*Thinking it through…*
1. *If you are not a Christian: What struck you about the talk today?*
2. *Does God’s judgement, and our guilt before him, feel real to you? How has our passage today helped you reflect on that more?*
3. *If you are a Christian: How does our passage help you appreciate your* *baptism and Jesus’ resurrection more?*

*Pray: 
*That our baptisms would remind us of the certain hope we have in Jesus. Pray that we’d hate sin and confidently live in this world as God’s people. Pray that those who don’t know Jesus yet might think seriously about judgement and the gift Jesus presents*
