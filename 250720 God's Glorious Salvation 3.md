*Isaiah 5*

## Does it matter?
- It really matters that we live holy lives, characterized by serving one another in good works.
- It matters that we bear good fruit.
## The Vineyard: The Story of God’s Fruitless People (v1-7)
- God cared about the provision of his people in the garden of Eden.
- It is difficult to maintain a vineyard.
- He looked to it to yield grapes, but they had wild grapes which were not good for winemaking.
## “Woe”: The Proof of their Fruitless Lives (v8-12, v18-23)
- "Woe" appears many times - it is proof of fruitless lives and precedes "therefore".
- v18, "Woe to those who draw iniquity" - this is referring to those who mock God and believe that He will never act, and that He doesn't exist.
- The bad behavior that we indulge in is symptoms of the unfruitful lives we lead.
## “Therefore”: The Consequence of their Fruitless Lives (v13-17, v24-30)
- God was absolutely serious about the consequences.
- He is deadly serious about judgment.
## Hope? (v15-16)
> The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. (Isa 2:11)
> 
> In that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel. 3 And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy (Isa 4:2-4)
> 
> (Also: Isaiah 27:2-6, Matthew 21:33-44)

- We should never leave God on hold, as His judgment is fierce and His promises are solid.

## Thinking it through…
1. *How has Isaiah shaped or changed your answer to the question, “Does it matter to God how we live?”*
2. *In what areas of life would you like to see more fruit, in light of Isaiah’s words? What makes you hopeful that change is possible?*

*Pray: Confess that we have often failed to bear fruit that honours God, and pray for the death of Jesus and the power of his Spirit to transform our lives.*
