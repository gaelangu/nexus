> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God.
> 1 *Peter 3:18*
# What's so good about the cross? 
- Everything Peter once thought about the cross was turned upside down. 
# The solution for sin
- Jesus' death on the cross was a complete solution to deal with sin.
- All sin is because of unrighteousness.
- Jesus' death was a substitution - the righteous suffered in place of the unrighteous.
- Jesus is offering his perfect goodness - far better than any other earthly substitutions - for our salvation.
# The way back to God
- Our way is put right and restored.
- Our religion says we need to do something good, so that we will earn our way to the top/heaven. All the work has been done in Christianity, which is symbolized in the cross.
