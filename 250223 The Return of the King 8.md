*Matthew 26:17-29*

# Introduction: The Immense Value of Jesus Christ.
- Jesus defines what He has done for us, in His own words.
- Doubt, fear creeps in among His closest friends.

# 1. 26:17-25 | The Son of Man Is Willingly Betrayed to Fulfill God’s Plan.
- This is God's plan, so Jesus walks willingly into this betrayal.
- Rejecting Jesus is foolish and rightly deserves punishment.
- Is Jesus Lord and King over everyone, or just a philosophy? 
# 2. 26:26-29 | God’s Plan Fulfilled!
> *Jeremiah 31:31-34*
> 
*31:31 “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. 33 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 34 And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*

*Thinking it through...*
1. *How does Judas’ betrayal help you see the gravity of sin and your need for Jesus?* 
2. *How does this passage shape your view of Jesus, and your relationship with God?*

*Pray: Thank God for sending us Jesus who willingly suffers and establishes this new covenant with Him. Ask him for help to treasure this forgiveness and relationship in all aspects of our lives.*
